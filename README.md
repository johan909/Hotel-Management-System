Overview
The Hotel Management System (HMS) is a Python-based application designed to automate and simplify the management of hotel operations. This system uses a database to store and manage customer information, room reservations, and billing. It provides a user-friendly interface to both hotel staff and administrators, enabling them to perform tasks such as booking rooms, checking in/out guests, managing room availability, and generating reports.

Check-In/Check-Out: Facilitates guest check-ins and check-outs, updating room status in the system.
Customer Management: Manages customer profiles, including personal details and reservation history.
Billing System: Generates invoices and bills based on room charges, extra services, and taxes.
Room Availability: Displays available rooms and their details (e.g., room type, price).
Reports: Generates reports related to bookings, revenue, and occupancy rates.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used to develop the system.
Database: SQLite (or any relational database like MySQL/PostgreSQL) to store hotel data, including rooms, reservations, and customer details.
Tkinter: (Optional) Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
