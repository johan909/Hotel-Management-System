Overview
The Hotel Management System (HMS) is a Java-based application designed to streamline and automate the management of hotel operations. This system uses a relational database to store and manage customer information, room reservations, check-ins/outs, and billing details. It offers a simple yet powerful interface for hotel staff and administrators to manage rooms, guest reservations, and generate reports efficiently.

Check-In/Check-Out: Facilitates guest check-ins and check-outs, updating room availability in real time.
Customer Management: Maintains customer profiles, including personal details, contact information, and reservation history.
Billing System: Calculates and generates bills based on room charges, additional services, and applicable taxes.
Room Availability: Displays a list of available rooms and their details such as type, price, and amenities.
Reports: Generates various reports, including booking summaries, revenue statistics, and occupancy rates.
Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language used to develop the system.
Database: MySQL (or any relational database like PostgreSQL or SQLite) for storing hotel data, including room details, customer information, and reservations.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Used to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Swing : Java Swing can be used for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
SQL: Used for querying and managing data in the database.
